/*
*   1. Grab the album id from the URL
*   2. Make a fetch request to backend with the albumId (localhost:3000/albums/1)
*   3. If album id is ok (code needs to be 200)(e.g. album was found) -> prefill the text fields with data from backend.
* Otherwise, redirect user to other page (like all albums).
*   4. Link albumId to buttons for further logic (save, delete, add)
